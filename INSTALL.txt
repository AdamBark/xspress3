INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING XSPRESS3 SOFTWARE FROM SCRATCH.

Note - I have put expicit versions for all downloaded software modules in this
text so I can have explicit paths to downloadable files. Naturally, these will
gradually go out of date, but you may choose later versions if you like.

1. Decide your directory structure
 - I suggest having everything under a well-known root. Potentially /opt/xspress3/epics, or /usr/local/epics. Then, for example the three main software areas will be:
   - Base:       /opt/xspress3/epics/R3.14.12.3/base/
   - Extensions: /opt/xspress3/epics/R3.14.12.3/extensions/
   - Modules:    /opt/xspress3/epics/R3.14.12.3/support/<module>

2. EPICS Base:
Download:
 - http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/download/base/baseR3.14.12.3.tar.gz

Build Base:
 - Untar base into the base directory above.
 - Follow the EPICS base build instructions
   - edit configure/CONFIG_SITE etc
   - declare DLS_HOST_ARCH environment variable.
   - Run make

3. EPICS Extensions
Download:
 - Extensions Top:
   - http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/download/extensions/extensionsTop_20120904.tar.gz
 - MSI 1.6
   - http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/download/extensions/msi1-6.tar.gz
 - medm 3.1.7
   - http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/download/extensions/medm3_1_7.tar.gz
 - edm 1.12.86
   - http://ics-web.sns.ornl.gov/edm/info/getAttachment.php?attachId=446&name=edm-1-12-86.tgz

Build extensions:
 - Untar extensionsTop into the extensions directory above.
 - Untar the other extensions applications into the extensions/src directory
 - Edit the extesnions/src/Makefile so
    - the MSI and MEDM declarations point to the right directory
    - There is an EDM declaration and there is also a DIRS += $(EDM) line.
 - Run make.

4. EPICS modules
Download:
 - asyn 4-21
   - http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/download/modules/asyn4-21.tar.gz
 - autosave 5-1
   - http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/tar/autosave_R5-1.tar.gz
 - busy 1-6
   - http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/tar/busy_R1-6.tar.gz
 - sscan 2-9
   - http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/tar/sscan_R2-9.tar.gz
 - calc 3-2
   - http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/tar/calc_R3-2.tar.gz
 - areaDetector 1-8
   - http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/pub/areaDetectorR1-8.tgz
 - devIocStats 3-1-11
   - http://sourceforge.net/projects/epics/files/devIocStats/devIocStats-3.1.11.tar.gz/download
 - spectraPlugins 1-4
   - http://controls.diamond.ac.uk/downloads/support/spectraPlugins/1-4/spectraPlugins-1-4.tgz
 - xspress3 1-4
   - http://controls.diamond.ac.uk/downloads/support/xspress3/1-4/xspress3-1-4.tgz

Build modules:
 - Edit the configure/RELEASE file in each module so definitions for the following are consistent:
SUPPORT
EPICS_BASE
ASYN
AUTOSAVE
BUSY
SSCAN
CALC
AREA_DETECTOR
DEVIOCSTATS
XSPRESS3_API (path to William's code).

 - Comment out configure/RELEASE definitions of SNCSEQ (in asyn and sscan) and IPAC (in asyn).
 - Edit RELEASE_SITE in devIocStats to set epics locations
 - Edit asApp/Db/Makefile adding the following line in the DB definitions: DB += save_restoreStatus.db
 - Ensure the base/bin/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH) and extensions/bin/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH) are on your PATH
 - Build the modules in the above order

5. Xspress3 example IOC.
There is an Xspress3 example IOC in the xspress3 module. To build it:
 - cd <xspress3 module>/iocs/xspress3Example
 - Edit configure/RELEASE to ensure it is consistent. You need a path to a Boost installation.
 - Run make
 - Start the IOC by running bin/${EPICS_HOST_ARCH}/stexample.sh
 - There will be some errors, but I will fix them in a later release.
