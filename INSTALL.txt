INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING XSPRESS3 SOFTWARE FROM SCRATCH.

Xspress3 has been tested using a blank RHEL6 workstation install. The
following packages needed to be installed:

For compilers
 - gcc-4.4.7-3.el6.x86_64
 - gcc-c++-4.4.7-3.el6.x86_64

For EPICS base
 - readline-devel-6.0-4.el6.x86_64

For medm and edm:
 - openmotif-devel-2.3.3-5.el6_3.x86_64

For areaDetector
 - libxml2-devel-2.7.6-12.el6_4.1.x86_64
 - bzip2-devel-1.0.5-7.el6_0.x86_64

For edm only:
 - libXtst-devel-1.2.1-2.el6.x86_64
 - giflib-devel-4.1.6-3.1.el6.x86_64

Once you have got this sorted, go through the following steps:

1. Decide your directory structure
I suggest having everything under a well-known root. Potentially:
  - /opt/xspress3/epics
  - /usr/local/xspress3
  - /home/$USER/software

Then, for example the main software areas could be:
  - Boost:      /opt/xspress3/boost
  - Base:       /opt/xspress3/epics/R3.14.12.3/base/
  - Extensions: /opt/xspress3/epics/R3.14.12.3/extensions/
  - Modules:    /opt/xspress3/epics/R3.14.12.3/support/<module>

2. Edit the INSTALL.sh script:
The first few lines of the INSTALL.sh script contains some of the locations
defined above for you to set, an http_proxy if you need it and where to put
the downloaded tar files. Edit these lines to reflect your preferences. You
can, of course, do more major edits if you want, but let me know why.
Alternatively, you can just use it as a guide to a manual install.

3. Run the INSTALL.sh script.
This should run to completion installing boost first, the EPICS base, and then
all the dependent modules.

4. Set your paths and EPICS_HOST_ARCH in your .bash_profile

5. Run the software:
 - xspress3-ioc.sh: to start the ioc.
 - xspress3-medm.sh: to start the medm screens.
 - xspress3-edm.sh: to start the edm screens.
